Assignment #6

This assignment is a kind of small application for the Curriculum Vitae. So that you will be
working on this app development from Week 5 to Week 9. Must bring out the proper outcome.

Problem 1: Curriculum Vitae App. [55 Points]
• Design an attractive android app to show your Curriculum Vitae (CV) using Fragments.
• You could use the design support library discussed in class (Material Design).
• According to your app requirement and creativity, you need to integrate the concepts at
least 60% from Lesson 7 and Lesson 8 such as menus, Tab Layout, SwipeViews, Bottom
Navigation, Shared Preferences, and WebView.
Sample Project Idea
Here, the one sample idea from my side is provided to you using Fragments. But you can use
your creativity to develop this app.
Design a screen with four tabs: Home, About me, Work Experience, and Contact. Feel free to
add more tabs according to your creativity.
Your name and Qualifications are visible, and it is common for other Fragments.
Perform the following:
1. Can create a login page to enter the home screen. Do the proper validation and retrieve
the last entered login credentials from Shared Preferences.
2. The Default fragment page is Home may contain your image in a Circular Image view,
Qualification, current position, etc.,
3. If the user selects the About me, describe yourself in that Fragment like educational
background, personal info, strengths, weakness, etc.,
4. If the user selects Work, describe your technical skills, experience, project info, etc., in
that Fragment. (Can use ListView, RecyclerView). Use FloatActionButton to add more
technical experience, project, etc.,
5. If the user selects Contact, it shows address, phone, email, Facebook, Twitter, etc. (Use
Implicit intent or WebView to take into Phone, Email, Facebook or Twitter, etc.,)
6. Use the Overflow menu to show additional options.
