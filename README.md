creativity.
Perform the following:

Quiz button. If you wish you can make Animated Splash screen or onboard screens.
2. Use Room DB for Data persistence and store at least 15 Questions with its answer.

button to take into the Welcome screen. Here I produced two sample questions to know
the UI design for showing questions.
