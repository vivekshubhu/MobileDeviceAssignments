This repository contains assignments of Mobile Device Programming course at MIU.


```
Problem 1: Create a Login page for the Walmart store. [25 Points]
Task :1 - Home page : activity_main.xml – Reuse the Home page from Lesson 4 

Task 2: We don’t have a database. So, create a User class which consists of firstname, lastname,
username (will be an email id) and password instances. Make a constructor to initialize the
values. Right click on your project by choosing File→ New → Kotlin File/Class to create a
User.kt file
Task 3:
Inside your MainActivity.kt, create an ArrayList for the type of User, and store at least five users
to validate login.
If the user click the Sign In button, validate the user in the ArrayList, if it match with your data,
then your Main Activity need to open the another intent Shopping Category activity as per the
below screen. From MainActivity.kt pass the username to ShoppingCategory activity and display
at the top welcome username as per the screen shot. If the user clicks the image, just display the
Toast message, that “You have chosen the Clothing category of shopping”. Similarly based on
the selection of image category display the toast message as per the chosen image.
Usage of Toast : A toast provides simple feedback about an operation in a small popup.

Task 5: From the above page if the user click Create a new account, this page directs to another
intent RegisterActivity as below.

From the login page screen, if the user click the Forget Password? Read the password
of the user from the list. Then use the implicit Intent Intent.Action_Send to send the stored
password to the registered email.
