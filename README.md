Problem – 1: Design the Dinner Decider app as per the requirement either hard coding or drag and drop UIs. 
Components need to be added are 
• ImageView
• TextView 
• EditText 
• Two Buttons for ADD FOOD and DECIDE!   

To create ImageView/ImageButton use the given code in your xml file. Copy dd_logo image on your res\drawable folder. The dd_logo.png file is available on your Lesson3 homework assignment folder.

Task A:
In your MainActivity.kt, add an ArrayList with default values { Hamburger, Pizza, Mexican, American, Chinese }.
If the user clicks the DECIDE! Button, randomly select the stored values from the ArrayList and then change the TextView with the random value.

Task B:
If the user is not happy with the default vales, they could add the food by typing in the EditText component and add the value by clicking the ADD FOOD button into ArrayList food.
